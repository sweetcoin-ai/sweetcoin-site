  <h1>Sweetcoin Whitepaper</h1>

  <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
  <p>Sweetcoin (symbol: SWTC) is a decentralized stablecoin governed with the assistance of AI, with its value anchored to the global average price of a basic ice cream cone.</p>
  <p>We are committed to building the first smart payment system that brings cryptocurrency into real-life scenarios. Sweetcoin not only supports on-chain transactions, but also allows you to scan and pay for an ice cream cone at a local shop through smart contracts and real-time price linkage mechanisms. It integrates blockchain transparency, AI-driven stability regulation, and the convenience of mobile payment, making it a trustworthy value unit you can show, scan, and use in daily life.</p>
  <p>Unlike stablecoins backed by USD, controlled by banks, or manipulated by central authorities, Sweetcoin aims to break the monopoly of financial institutions, national credit, and centralized powers over monetary systems. By anchoring to real-world consumer goods and enabling AI to regulate issuance and burning, Sweetcoin takes a key step toward democratized governance and practical usage of stablecoins.</p>
  <p>Sweetcoin is both an experiment and a signal: the future of money should be determined by public consensus and intelligent systems—not by centralized powers.</p>

  <h2>2. Core Mechanisms</h2>
  <h3>1. Anchoring Mechanism</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sweetcoin’s target price is anchored to the global average price of a basic ice cream cone.</li>
    <li>This anchor is regularly analyzed by AI based on global consumption data and uploaded via decentralized oracles.</li>
    <li>The initial reference price is set at $0.00618.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. AI Regulation Mechanism</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Issuance and burning functions are exposed via interfaces and may be controlled by AI in the future.</li>
    <li>The system continuously learns from market fluctuations to optimize token supply and maintain the anchor.</li>
    <li>Currently, issuance is controlled by administrators, but AI access is reserved.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Dual-Chain Deployment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ethereum mainnet for authoritative issuance and value anchoring.</li>
    <li>Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for daily payments and high-speed transactions.</li>
    <li>Both chains use the same contract logic and reserve cross-chain interfaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Decentralization Design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No seigniorage, forced fees, or centralized accounts are retained in the contract.</li>
    <li>All users may claim a fixed token amount after reading the instructions.</li>
    <li>DAO and multi-signature governance will be explored in the future.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Participation</h2>
  <h3>1. Free Claim</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each wallet address may claim 20 SWTC tokens for free.</li>
    <li>Users must read contract instructions and pass basic verification before claiming.</li>
    <li>Merkle Tree will prevent duplicate claims.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. On-Chain Usage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can transfer and use SWTC with any Web3-compatible wallet.</li>
    <li>The contract includes a pause function to freeze transfers during emergency situations.</li>
    <li>QR code and POS-based payment systems will be gradually integrated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Future Expansion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Whitelist and blacklist functions are reserved for extreme risk situations only.</li>
    <li>Upgradeable contract framework is embedded for future development.</li>
    <li>Metadata interface allows wallet/browser to auto-detect contract details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Merchant Support</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sweetcoin provides QR code generator tools for merchants to set wallet addresses and amounts, enabling instant payment.</li>
    <li>An open merchant map platform will allow self-submission and admin approval for visibility.</li>
    <li>The system will progressively build global “decentralized currency-friendly zones.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Team Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Sweetcoin project is built by an anonymous team who values peace. Our philosophy: break monopolies, rebuild trust, and end financial exploitation with decentralized money.</p>
  <p>20% of the initial tokens are reserved for team incentives; the remaining 80% is fully allocated for market circulation and ecosystem development.</p>
